    <h1>Sam Buxbaum</h1>

    <p>I'm a 4th year undergraduate at UVA studying computer science and physics. Upon graduation, I would like to pursue
        a PhD in applied security and cryptography. I am particularly interested in internet security and privacy
        and the dream of a fully open and decentralized internet.

    <h2>Research Projects</h2>

    <h4>Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning</h4>
    I'm working with professors David Wu and Yuan Tian and 2 other students to develop a library for 
    3-party privacy-preserving machine learning. My responsibilities have included protocol development,
    implementation, testing, and error analysis.

    <h4>Post-Quantum Cryptography</h4>
    <p>I'm working with professor Mohammad Mahmoody on a project in post-quantum cryptography. I have become
        familiar with topics including interactive proofs of quantumness, post-quantum reductions, 
        and black-box separations.
    </p>

    <h4>Deepfake Detection</h4>
    <p>I'm working on a deepfake detection system with classmate Ahmed Hussain. Whereas most existing
        systems work by detecting subtle flaws in the fake media, we take the assumption
        that deepfake generation techniques will someday produce results that are truly
        indistinguishable from reality, so a different approach entirely is necessary. Our
        approach is to create and maintain a list of "valid" media, and all other media is
        considered "invalid." Since identifying all valid media is a daunting task, we start
        with the comparatively simple goal of recognizing and protecting news-related media.
    </p>
    <p>We hash the media to store it in a space-efficient manner. We have largely reduced the overall
        problem to the fundamental technical problem of constructing a hash function that combines
        elements of cryptographic hashing and perceptual hashing. More information is available
        in the summary below.
    </p>
    <p>The project has been recognized with a competition award, a

        and conversations with a representative of the federal government and the Chief Data Scientist at Intel.

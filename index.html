    <h2>Research Projects</h2>

    <h4>Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning</h4>
    I'm working with professors David Wu and Yuan Tian and 2 other students to develop a library for 3-party privacy-preserving machine learning. I have been responsible for our nonlinear functions: division, inverse square root, and batch normalization. I have implemented the functions, experimentally tested the results, and theoretically analyzed the error.

    <h4>Post-Quantum Primitive Relationships</h4>
    <p>I'm working with professor Mohammad Mahmoody on a project about the fundamental relationships
        between cryptographic primitives in the classical and post-quantum settings, 
        specifically how relationships can differ between the two settings. Our primary research
        question is: can we identify a primitive that classically implies one-way functions but does not
        post-quantumly?
    </p>

    <h4>Deepfake Detection</h4>
    <p>I'm working on a deepfake detection system with Ahmed Hussain. Whereas most existing
        systems work by detecting subtle flaws in the fake media, we take the assumption
        that deepfake generation techniques will someday produce results that are truly
        indistinguishable from reality, so a different approach entirely is necessary. Our
        approach is to create and maintain a list of "valid" media, and all other media is
        considered "invalid". Since identifying all valid media is a daunting task, we start
        with the comparatively simple goal of recognizing and protecting news-related media.
    </p>
    <p>We hash the media to store it in a space-efficient manner. We have largely reduced the overall
        problem to the fundamental technical problem of constructing a hash function that combines
        elements of cryptographic hashing and perceptual hashing. More information is available
        in the summary below.
    </p>
    <p>The project has been recognized with a competition award, a national news interview, and 
        conversations with a representative of the federal government and the Chief Data Scientist at Intel.
